Simple Arduino temperature monitoring stuff with Munin
==============

Two (Serial and Web) implementations done with different hardware

Munin plugins written in Python for plotting

## Tested hardware

Serial stuff was done with NTC sensors and on an older Arduino Duemilanove

Web stuff was done with DS1820 (the most simple ones from Ebay) and a Arduino Uno. 
Ethernet shield was a cheapo ENC28J60 based version (from Ebay)
